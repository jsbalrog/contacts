## Using this repository to follow the demo

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/buffalobillion/contacts.git

Change into the directory:

    cd contacts

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 00_blank_slate origin/00_blank_slate

You can review the list of local branches by running:

    git branches

And you can switch between branches with the checkout command. For example, to check out the `12_xtemplate_from_DOM` branch, run:

    git co 12_xtemplate_from_DOM
